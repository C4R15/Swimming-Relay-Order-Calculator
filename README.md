# Swimming Relay Order Calculator üèä
### What is the purpose of this website?
The user can enter swimmers' names and times via completing a form on the site - this will be stored on a database. They can then detail the requirements of a relay team and select which swimmers they want to include, from which they will receive a report on different combinations of swimmers and strokes with their total time and an option to download.

### Why have I created this?
I've sometimes seen my coaches struggle with who to put in a relay team, and for medley relays who to put on each stroke (as they may be faced with many swimmers good at the same strokes), so I decided to take on this project for my Advanced Higher assignment.

##### Limitations of this project. üòî
As there is the constraint of 9 months to complete this assignment (in addition to other school work) I have decided on the following:
* No user login / indivdual (private) records.
* Upload via html form and export via CSV only.
* Will be hosted on heroku until such a time I want/can afford hosting.

Mark awarded: `100%` - 60% of the overall grade.
